Study of aminoacid frequencies in protein secondary structures
1.Data and preprocessing
	Input Data: .pdb files
	Required Steps to process the data:
		Preprocessing the .pdb files
		Obtaining the AA frecuencies
		Prepare them for te visualization
	Potential results:secondary structures "helix", "beta" and other coils visualization.

2. Project goals
	Milestone 1: Collect information
		WP1: Learn about protein' secondary tructures --> 4 hours 
		WP2: Learn about PDB database --> 8 hours
		WP3: Learn about pdb files --> 8 hours
		WP4: Learn about scripts and related commands ---> 8 hours
	Milestone 2: Debugging the scripts


	Milestone 3: Select and download the protein structure files from PDB
		Deliverable1: Folder with PDB files
		Deliverable2: Frequency results
		Deliverable3: potential secondary structures

3. Libraries, tools and software requirements

4. Required Python scripts
	Python script1:01_download/01run.sh
	Python script2:02_parse_pdb/01run.sh
	Python script3:03_visualize/01run.shStudy of aminoacid frequencies in protein secondary structures
